"""
The ScriptRepository parser is responsible for parsing the whole repository
in order to update the information that is available at the repository.json 
file. It belongs to the Script Repository Web Service. 

It goes through the repository tree, looking into each file to produce 
the entries of the repository.json. 

The repository.json is formed with the following structure: 
    
    path of the directory/file
        pub_date: the date when the file was last modified
        directory: flag that indicates if the entry is a directory of a file
        description: the description of the file or directory. 

This structure, can be created by the json module, using a python dictionary
whose value is a dictionary. 

.. code-block: python

    {'path':{'description':'file description','pub_date':'today'}}

        
The :func:`parse_repository` function is responsible for iterating over all the 
files inside the repository. Than, it ask the make_entry to form the 
entry for the python structure.

In order to get the description of the entries, :func:`make_entry` depends on the
:func:`get_description` function. 

The ScriptRepository design defined that the documentation of a directory
is the same as the documentation of its direct child __init__.py or README
file. So, these functions passes the information if the description of 
the current entry could be used to describe its parent directory.
